# Ruffix

An extremely simple Sublime Text plugin to run `ruff --fix` on the current view.

I'll probably add deeper functionality in future like a sidebar context menu to fix an entire folder or project.

## Installation

Just use Package Control - `ctrl-shift-p`, select `Package Control: Install Package`, search for `ruffix`.


## Usage

Open a Python file, open the command palette, type `ruffix` and hit return, or hit `super-option-r`
